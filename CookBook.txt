The feature nomenclature is defined by a set of word/tokens divided by dots. The possible tokens are:

Time: Time signal
Fourier: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the signal
Body: Body accelaration signal
Jerk : Jerk signal
Acc: Signal from the accelerometer
Gyro: Signal from the gyroscope 
Gravity: Gravity signal
Mag: Magnitude of the three dimensional signal, in this case that means Euclidean norm.
X/Y/Z: Axis of the signal
mean: Mean of the signal
std: Standard deviation of the signal

For example Fourier.Body.Acc.mean.X represents the FFT of the body linear acceleration signal mean along the X axis. 

Moreover, the first two columns "Subject" and "Activity" describe the subject tracked and the activity performed respectively.
